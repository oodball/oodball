# Oodball's Website!

This is my website to dump out parts of my life that I don't usually share because I'm not a huge yapper. Instead of me yapping at you, you can come willingly to my page and read my stuff so I don't feel guilty for overloading you with information.

For anybody who actually goes to my github and read my README file, either you're a recruiter (hi) or Himesama (hi)(me)

Currently there are 4 main components too oodball.com:
-  Foodball
    * where I share all of my food adventures plus a restraurant review
- Filmball
    * A WIP: Supposed to show my movie reviews, when I watch them
- Embroodball
    * A digital log of all my embroidery activities
- Digiball
    * A picture gallery composed of shots I'm proud of taking on my digicam

Now you may wonder "Oodball how do you have so much time to update all of these things?"

I don't.

I think I'll be updating the Foodball page the most since I like trying new food places. Maybe digiball too since I'll be taking pics, but I need to commit to creating a project for embroidery and that takes willpower and time. 

As for filmball, I usually take a while to watch something, so I'll update it when I have time.
