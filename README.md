# Oodball's Website!

Currently there are 4 main components to oodball.com:
-  Foodball
    * where I share all of my food adventures plus a restraurant review
- Filmball
    * A WIP: Supposed to show my movie reviews, when I watch them
- Embroodball
    * A digital log of all my embroidery activities
- Digiball
    * A picture gallery composed of shots I'm proud of taking on my digicam


I'll be updating the Foodball page the most since I like trying new food places. The other pages will come if I have inspiration.
