Date I went: 7/12/25

I feel like the qualities of my entries have gone down recently. I have a pretty big backlog of restaurants I want to write about, and I'll definitely have more in about two weeks too, so I'm trying to get each one out as quickly as possible. 

While I probably don't have to write about each and every single food I eat, I think that I want to brag about the diverse types of food I ate. Call me a show-off or whatever but I want more diverse types of cuisines and foods on this page. 

In any case, I'll spend more time on this entry just for you guys. 

Definitely not because I have alot to say about Khao Thai in the first place. 

We weren't really planning on trying Thai food in Canada, but we ended up not knowing what to look for and found this place on Google with many good ratings. Since we don't regularly eat Thai food at home, I was starting to crave a good Thai curry. 

The main thing I can say about the restaurant is how good the customer service is. Ottawa is humid and hot in the summer, and the only seats they had when we walked in were on the patio. While we sat down anyways, they quickly moved us inside when there was a free table. 

I noticed that the same waitress seemed to be really friendly too, since she was talking to everybody that was sitting down near us. While I usually hate that type of stuff, her conversations were pretty tailored and it sounded like she genuinely just liked talking to people. 

## FOOD

***Green Papaya Salad***

I hate ripe papaya. I think it tastes too fragrant and it leaves a really nasty aftertaste in my mouth. I tried convincing my parents that I was allergic to it when I was little but it didn't work. 

That's because of this dish. 

They fed me a green papaya salad without telling me and I really liked it because it tasted like pickled daikon and carrots in banh mi. 

Anyways, point being that green papaya salad is the only form acceptable for papaya since it has no papaya taste and my love for pickles overcomes my hatred for papaya. And I'm not allergic to papaya.

This was just a standard papaya salad. Nothing particularly stood out to me, so I'll just give this an average rating. It was a good way to cut through all the oil that the rest of the food had though. 

3/5

***Massaman Curry***

This was one dish that I requested before even going to the restaurant. I knew that I wanted curry, so when I took a look at the menu on Google, I knew that this had to be the one. I've never had it before, but it was only a choice between this curry dish and another one since my mom can't handle spice well. The reviews said that the massaman curry was a must try, and who am I to ignore the people?

The people have taste. I thoroughly enjoyed this curry. I wasn't expecting it to be so watery, so I'm glad we had a side of rice to go along with it. The flavors mixed well together, but I think the chefs were too heavy-handed with the coconut milk. I know that it's a staple ingredient, but the coconut overpowered the rest of the dish. 

Other than that, the only complaint that I really have is just the ratio of the sauce to ingredients. There was a significant amount of curry sauce leftover after we finished, but it was too heavy to have on its own, and there was no more rice left. 

3.5/5

***Gailan Cured Pork***

This dish was too oily. I can tell that they added extra oil on top of the oil that was released by the cured fatty pork. The pork was just a little too salty, but it was balanced out by the gailan, which was blander. 

This dish is mid. I wouldn't order it at a restaurant, but I could definitely make it myself at home. 

2.5/5

***Mango Coconut Sticky Rice***

I don't usually put prices in my entries because It makes me highly aware of just how much I spend on food. But listen. This mango sticky rice was only $10 CAD. 

I knew immediately after reading the menu that we had to have an order of the sticky rice. I was expecting an unbalanced rice to mango ratio with too much rice since it was so cheap, but even then, the price justified the purchase. 

We had to order this one to go since we were so full after eating all the other dishes. And I was the genius who suggested we take it to the park to watch the river so we could digest the food on the way there. 

This dish had me on my knees when I opened it. They gave us an entire mango with a small scoop of rice on top. There wasn't any fancy decorations or inedible flowers to spruce up the dish, but this dish was so beautiful. 

The rice was perfectly seasoned with just enough coconut milk to keep it still firm. And the mango was so soft and perfectly ripe. They were so generous with the mango that I didn't have enough rice to finish it. For once, I'm happy about the inequal ratio, because having mango to finish off the dish cleanses all the heaviness of the coconut rice.

I think this trip was worth it purely because I found mango sticky rice for so cheap here. 

5/5
## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I strongly recommend this place. The prices were extremely reasonable for what you're getting, and they're very generous with their portions. For a place with over 1000 reviews in a tourist area, they don't raise their prices above normal just to gain profit. 

The service was above standards, and it shows in the way that locals come in and interact with the staff. I felt very welcomed here. 

I would endure Ottawa again just to eat here.
