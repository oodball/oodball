For some reason, meat pies are a must-try in Montreal. The name of them don't sound very appealing, but they quite literally are just meat in a dough pastry filling. When I looked up meat pie places in Montreal, I happened to read Hugh Jackman's praises on Ta Pies. Since it's Mr. Jackman and he's Australian and knows meat pies better than I do, I decided to trust him and see if what he was hyping up to be the "best meat pies in the world."

This restaurant has an identity crisis. The description on Google says that it's a New Zealand restaurant, but the description says "Australian classics." Not that I would know the difference. I didn't even register that Australians had their own cuisine. I still don't think they do. Meat pies shouldn't even count. There are so many different variations of meat in a pastry shell. The only difference is that supposedly Australia goes through a lot of them.

The lady working the front deserves a raise. She was very patient in answering our questions, and also not reacting at all when my mom just ordered a "coffee." Then when I told her to specify what type of coffee from the list (Americano, Espresso, etc.), she said "a hot coffee." 

I wouldn't survive a day in customer service.

***Overall Thought***

I'm going to condense it all into one review because there isn't much to say about them, and I didn't have much of the other pies. 

We ordered the original meat pie, the sausage roll, and a butter chicken meat pie. I only had a bite of the original meat pie and the butter chicken, but I can already tell you that the butter chicken was the best out of all of them. 

The sausage roll was pretty dry, and didn't bring me much joy by the end of the roll. It's a cheap eat to make you full, but nothing stood out. Same with the original meat pie. After putting ketchup on it, it became a bit juicier though. 

But the butter chicken pie was good. It was juicy, and well flavored. I think that this meat pie alone made the average score rise. 

2.6/5


## OVERALL THOUGHTS

For a quick snack, I think that this place is worth trying out, but only if you're already in the area. I think that the meat pies were good, but pretty ordinary. I would buy it again, but it's not something that I would crave. I saw alot of people going in and out of the restaurant, so it has to be somewhat decent though.

Hugh Jackman should stick to the film industry. (his taste probably isn't terrible he's just Australian)
