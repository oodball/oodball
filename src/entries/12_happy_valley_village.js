Everbody cheer, I'm almost at the end of my backlog of restaurants.

When we got to Toronto after driving 5 hours, we intended to go eat king crab at this one place that Hana's parents told us to go to 10 years ago. After having so much French and fried food lately, it was getting to the point in the trip where we had to eat the food of the homeland. That's just how it is. 

When we got to the place, the parking lot was suspiciously empty. 

It was closed until the day after we leave Toronto. 

How fun. 

The owner redirected us to his other restaurant. He said they served the same dishes, but on Google Maps, they definitely weren't the same dishes. Or prices. And the ratings were significantly lower. Seems like a scam so we said "Okay, we'll go" and dipped. 

There has to be good Chinese food in this area, so we just decided to use Google Maps again. My only request was no hot pot. Eating something that hot would be hell in this weather.

So obviously we went to eat dry pot.
    
## FOOD

***Liang Pi***

Liang Pi is one of my favorite dishes to eat when it's hot. I love cold noodles, and the noodles with the crunchy cucumbers and peanuts is refreshing and easy to eat. 

This particular dish was a little too sour. There was too much vinegar in the sauce, which made it a little hard to eat as an appetizer. However, I really liked the frozen tofu. The veggies were also cut at a perfect thickness, and there was just the right ratio. The noodles were just a bit softer than I like them, but since there was such a good ratio of veggies, it cancelled some of the disappointment out. 

After going back for a second round, I suddenly found out there was also meat in the Liang Pi. While usually I'd be happy to find meat, this one was pretty dry and ruined the texture of the dish. 

2.5/5

***Goose Iron Pot with Dumplings***

I've never had iron pot I think. My mom wanted to come here solely because she wanted to try their iron pot, and no other option on the list looked good enough except for the goose. It's just wetter than dry pot, but it doesn't have enough soup to be considered hot pot. 

The flavor in this dish was good when it wasn't burning my tongue. There were too many bones in the goose, but that's not really the chef's fault. The textures of the dish worked well together, and they weren't overpowering one another. The dumplings were just cooked enough to give a chewiness on the bottom. I wouldn't eat them on their on because it was kind of dry, but when eaten soaked in some broth, it tasted fine.

The biggest surprise of this dish was actually the corn. I wasn't expecting it to be glutinous corn. I liked this one the most. It would have been fine to have normal corn, but the slight chewiness of this elevated the dish. 

3.5/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I had an interesting new experience here. It took me a while to write this article because I wasn't really feeling like writing it, but I wanted to show off that I ate new foods. 

If there were a restaurant like this closer to me, I would go again.
