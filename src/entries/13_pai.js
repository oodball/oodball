We're almost to the end of the Canada Series. Writing and posting these all delayed makes me feel like a k-pop idol who doesn't post because of how many fans would come. Don't stalk me when I catch up to my posting routine. I know how much you all want to.

Pai was a very last minute decision that we came to when we were walking along the PATH in Toronto. By this time I already ran out of my high speed data, so I was counting on my dad to find something good. The closest was Pai, which had a suspicious amount of reviews (in the thousands). 

We found out later it's been a Michelin guide restaurant for several years. 

Pai is a really trendy Thai place, very unlike Khao Thai, which seemed more old-school traditional in their decorating. Pai looked like a Thai restaurant if you were aiming to please people who haven't been to Thailand, There were colorful umbrellas everywhere, and loud statement walls of records. I was a bit overwhelmed coming in. 

Stepping into Pai is like stepping into Narnia. There's just one small door as an entrance, but when you open the door, the actual restaurant space is insanely large. The restaurant seating spans multiple rooms, and yet the entire place is packed with people. 

Also the staff were all very young. Probably to keep up with the trendy image. But they looked so young it made me feel like I was contibuting to child labor.
## FOOD

***Pineapple Shake and Thai Tea***

There isn't much to say about the pineapple shake. It's literally just blended pineapple. 

3/5

I don't actually know what good thai tea is supposed to taste like. I'm not a big fan of it because it makes my head hurt when I drink too much, but this one felt alright. It's too sweet though. 

2.5/5

***Khao Soi***

![Spread](/images/Foodball/pai/spread.JPG "Carried by the Lime")

When I looked online at the menu, this one was the dish that everyone said you had to order. The bowl came out with this fried wonton skin-like dough, and it looked super fancy. I had high expectations since it was so hyped up and the pictures looked so nice. 

That's pretty much all it is though.

For me, the taste was too bland. I know it's supposed to be made with coconut milk, but the noodles along with the blander broth made it quite hard to eat. The dish was heavy as well, so I quickly got tired of it. I understand why they gave me a lime to put into the dish. However, it wasn't good enough to save the dish as a whole. 

This felt like a peacock in food form.

2/5

***Panang Curry***

I remember liking this curry. 

Too bad I don't remember enough to give you guys a thorough review. My bad. 

3.5/5

***Mango Sticky Rice***

The rice to mango ratio on this dish was too high. This is a perfect example of when restaurants prioritize looks over the dish itself, since the rice was mid, but the dish itself looked pretty. I think that I wouldn't have thought this before I went to Khao Thai, but this dish really was just subpar. 

The dish itself was quite literally just rice and mango. Which I know is the point of a mango sticky rice, but it felt incomplete. 

2/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I think that Pai prioritized image over taste. All the dishes are so colorful and well presented, but when you taste it, it's just a regular dish, if not slightly underwhelming. Compared to Khao Thai, which wasn't even Michelin guide, the service, portion sizes, and taste left me wanting to go back there instead. Or any other Thai place I've been to.
