    content: `## INTRODUCTION
Congratulations we made it to Foodball: Asia edition. I'm trying to upload these as fast as I can because I know that the next while will be full of eating food. Some of it might make it onto Foodball, some of it won't. I'm too lazy to update 2-3 times a day.

It'll be hard to describe the foods we eat sometimes because I'm really bad at translating and sometimes I just don't know the name of what I'm eating. Everyone thank Himetsai for letting me be a passenger princess this trip.

Actually, 宏記豆漿 is a place that Therese and I found on Google Maps. We were so jet-lagged we woke up at 5 AM, so we decided to venture out into the city by ourselves. How brave of us. 

On Google Maps, this place is actually only called "Chinese Breakfast and Soy Milk" in English, but that seemed like a boring title so I went through great pain (Google Translate) to translate it for my dear fans. Thanks everyone for your support. 

## FOOD

***Egg Pancake***

An egg pancake is exactly what it sounds like. It's just egg on a thin dough rolled up. Sometimes it's a scallion pancake too, which I prefer more. This was just a regular dough.

Even though it's so simple, this dish is my favorite thing to order.

The pancake was very crispy and flaky, which I really liked. There was a slight crunch when biting down that I found very satisfying.

To be honest, the dish was very salty, but that was probably our own fault because we added too much sauce to it. We're American, we don't know these things.

3.5/5

***Soy Milk***

To be honest, it tasted like a normal soy milk. It was a bit too sweet for me, but I usually like adjusting my sugar levels so it was just a regular soy milk. 

3/5

***Radish Cake***

To be honest, the texture of Taiwanese radish cakes is subpar compared to the Hong Kong ones. I like my radish cakes firmer, but these ones almost fell apart as soon as I picked them up with my chopsticks. Other than that, the flavor was fine. 

2.5/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I think that if we weren't jet-lagged, we could have gone further and found a further breakfast place, but I liked this place. I think that the food itself can be found anywhere so it doesn't stand out to me, but I wouldn't mind coming back and ordering more.
