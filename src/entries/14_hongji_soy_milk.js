    content: `## INTRODUCTION
Congratulations we made it to Foodball: Asia edition. I'm trying to upload these as fast as I can because I know that the next while will be full of eating food. Some of it might make it onto Foodball, some of it won't. I'm too lazy to update 2-3 times a day.

It'll be hard to describe the foods we eat sometimes because I'm really bad at translating and sometimes I just don't know the name of what I'm eating. Everyone thank Himetsai for letting me be a passenger princess this trip.

Actually, 宏記豆漿 is a place that Therese and I found on Google Maps. We were so jet-lagged we woke up at 5 AM, so we decided to venture out into the city by ourselves. How brave of us. 

On Google Maps, this place is actually only called "Chinese Breakfast and Soy Milk" in English, but that seemed like a boring title so I went through great pain (Google Translate) to translate it for my dear fans. Thanks everyone for your support.

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

This was a great introduction to the trip. I think that if we weren't lazy, we could have gone further and found a further breakfast place, but I liked this place well enough. I think that the food itself can be found anywhere so it doesn't stand out to me, but I wouldn't mind coming back and getting another Egg Pancake.
