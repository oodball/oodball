    ***Butter Chicken with Scallion Pancake***

    A genius invention if I do say so myself. 

    What really made this dish genius was the incorporation of a scallion pancake instead of naan. The crispiness of the scallion pancake along with the amount of salt and flavor in it was really nicely paired with the curry.

    But garlic herbal naan still is the best. 

    The ratio of sauce to meat was pretty bad though. There was so much sauce by the end of it that it felt like we didn't eat any of it. It felt pretty wasteful. 

    A big part of the wastefulness was due to the design of the takeout box though.
