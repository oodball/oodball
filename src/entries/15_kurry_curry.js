I biked extra long to get here. I'm not good at riding bikes. I accidentally crashed into a wall trying to avoid hitting a family.

***Butter Chicken with Scallion Pancake***

A genius invention if I do say so myself. 

What really made this dish genius was the incorporation of a scallion pancake instead of naan. The crispiness of the scallion pancake along with the amount of salt and flavor in it was really nicely paired with the curry.

But garlic herbal naan still is the best. 

The ratio of sauce to meat was pretty off though. There was so much sauce by the end of it that it looked like we didn't eat any of it. It felt pretty wasteful.

A big part of the wastefulness was due to the design of the takeout box. the pockets were too deep for us to comfortably reach wtih plastic forks, and the fact that we had forks at all is a problem since they can't scoop up any sauce.

I think the biggest problem with this dish is not with the flavor, but with the fact that the scallion pancakes are already cut up into pieces. I hate eating my curry like a pizza. It made it so that I can't use my hands to scoop up the rest of the sauce I wasted.

2.5/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I think this restaurant is pretty good if you consider it a good mix to introduce curry to the Taiwanese and not just a curry place. The butter chicken is tame enough that most people aren't scared by it, and there are other options that cater more to the Taiwanese, and the usage of the classic scallion pancakes lull people into trying out something new. 

Maybe I'll have a different experience if I go back to dine in person.
