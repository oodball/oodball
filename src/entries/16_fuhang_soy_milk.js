    content: `## INTRODUCTION

I'd like to thank my three subscribers for being so dedicated to Foodball. For everybody unaware, I just allowed for push notifications. I felt pretty silly sending each and every one of you a text everytime about me posting an article. It felt like a beg for attention, like I was a kid trying to show off an art project. Sending out a push notification made me feel more nonchalant. Read the article. Or don't.

I'm going to be the most nonchalant food blogger out there.

When I got to this place, my first thought was "ain't no way this place is that good." The line goes out the entrance, down a flight of stairs, and then out the building and around the corner. It seems pretty intimidating if you just want a breakfast. But since I have bad FOMO, I decided to stick around. 

## FOOD

***Sweet Soy Milk***

Just like any other soy milk tbh. I don't really notice a difference besides that they add more sugar to it. I'm slightly disappointed that they serve it in a bowl though. It's kind of messy to eat unless you straight up slurp from the bowl, but then there's no point in the spoon. 

3/5

***Salty Soy Milk***

While we were in line, a Taiwanese man gleefully informed us about the history of salty soy milk. YOu don't want to know. While he was busy giggling to himself (before he even told us about the history), I could already tell that this dish would be something.

That Taiwanese man was Himetsai by the way.

That something was terrible. I am not a fan of salty soy milk. In fact I might even be a hater. I think that the warm consistency of it, with slight chunks and how much thicker it was than regular soy milk was offputting. The saltiness of the youtiao with this salty soy milk also just didn't taste good to me. 

I couldn't eat more than one bite of this dish. Shout out to Therese for finishing it.

In fact, this dish gets the lowest rating in Foodball History.

0/5

***Shao Bing with Youtiao***

Shao bing is bread that is fired in an oven. Fuhang is known for their Shao Bing. Youtiao is a fried Chinese Donut.

I personally believe that these are better off eaten separately. While I love each one on its own, the combination of the two makes for too much dough at one time. 

Also, I realized the reason why the soy milk was sold in a bowl was probably for the reason of dipping this dish into the soy milk.

Personally I preferred eating the youtiao without dipping.

2/5

***Dan Bing***

The best thing I had at this table. I think that the sauce to pancake ratio was very well distributed. It wasn't as salty as the last time we had it (our fault). 

If I had to nitpick one thing, it would just be my preference of how crispy things the pancake was. I really like a nice crust on my dan bing, so that the first bite is crispy. This was a bit soggy, but the flavor was still really good

3.5/5


## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I think my original assessment of the shop was right. It was pretty overhyped. Paired with the fact that there aren't enough tables and people were constantly watching you like a hawk to see when you finished your food made it pressuring to just sit and enjoy my food. 

I think that you should just go somewhere else if you're in a time crunch. The food was pretty standard to me, and there's probably a shorter wait time. Fuhang felt overrun, especially since they also share their tables with other restaurants in the food court.
