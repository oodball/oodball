    content: `## INTRODUCTION
I'm trying to get out a bunch of Foodball entries before school starts. I'm also very caffeinated because I'm still jet lagged so some of my words might not make sense.

This entry has my thoughts from when they were still fresh in my mind and I still had the thought to write them all down as they came. Future oodball doesn't have that type of thought anymore so keep that in mind. Future Oodball actually got sick for a long while and forgot about updating for a bit.

Raohe Night Market is arguably one of Taipei's most well-known night markets. According to a trusted source that I refuse to name, many celebrities show up at the night market just to walk around and eat. 

That night, Raohe Night Market's celebrity was me. 

## FOOD

Small disclaimer, I forgot to take pictures while we were walking around and eating, so there are only a few pictures. My bad. 

***Sausage and Rice Sausage***

If a street market doesn't have at least one stall selling sausages you should leave. In American terms, having a sausage cart is as essential as walking out of the club or a concert at 2 AM and seeing those hot dog carts lined up for you.

This was my favorite food of the night. There was the perfect flavor of garlic that was added to the sausage. It's pretty hard to go wrong with it, but the best part is that you pick it up and eat it with a clove of raw garlic after each bite. The crunch, along with the mild spiciness really amplifies the flavor. 

I was a bit confused that the sausage was sweet though. It worked surprisingly well, especially with the garlic. 

The rice sausage with a regular sausage (think a hot dog but the bun is a cut open rice sausage) is quite literally called "Big sausage wrapped around small sausage." I can think of a few things like that.

Anyways.

The sausage hot dog was topped with minimally grilled garlic, so each bite was full of the same garlicky taste that the regular sausage had. To be honest, I almost preferred this one solely because I didn't have to hold the garlic and the sausage in each hand like a greedy little kid. 

My only real complaint about this dish is that there's a layer of casing that's pretty hard to bite through, so each bite wasn't clean.

4/5

***Oyster and Pork Intestine***

I'm sure this dish would hit better if I actually liked pork intestine and oysters. From what I hear it was really good. 

I'm not the best judge so don't take this rating at face value.

2.5/5

***Tang Yuan with Shaved Ice***

I'm very particular about my shaved ice.

That doesn't mean I won't eat any shaved ice because I love it too much, but I really like the bowls with real crushed ice. Not the fluffy milky stuff. It's still good, but I just like the texture of pure ice.

Even better was that the ice is unlimited here. I'd come back in the winter just for it. 

This place had the option of adding lemon juice on the ice. It makes my mouth water just thinking about it again. 

You guys already know that I can eat an entire lemon without flinching. 

Even though nobody else liked the lemon juice, I would love to put more on it. In comparison, the osmanthus syrup that was provided felt almost fermented? I liked it in smaller, more subtle portions. 

Something to note is that the tang yuan got cold sitting on the ice. I expected this, but I prefer my tang yuan warm, with the sesame filling oozing out instead of just sitting inside the ball. It's not a big problem though. 

We went back for two more servings of ice after our initial one.

4.5/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

Even though I didn't run into any other fellow celebrities, Raohe Night Market is a place you should definitely go to. There were more things that we didn't get to try, like the black pepper buns, glutenous rice balls, or the stinky tofu. There's something here for everybody, and the food is comparatively cheap and tasty.
