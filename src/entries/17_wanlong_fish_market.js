    ***sashimi plate***

    just usual sashimi tbh, not really outstanding
    not much to it
    pretty thick slices
    did notice a bit of chewiness so it ruined the texture a bit

    mountain of wasabi was very satisfying

    2.5/5

    ***miso soup***
    unlimited
    many toppings
    very good flavor, not too salty

    realy liekd the tofu in it

    there's pieces of fish? that made it pretty fishy when you got those pieces so i prefer if they left it out

    3/5
