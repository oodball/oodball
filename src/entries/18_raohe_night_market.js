***Sausage and Rice Sausage***

Why is it so sweet
i really like it though
perfect flavor
loved the garlic, perfectly grilled but sitll has the raw garlic kick to it

rice was sticky, somtiems not good with the skin bc it doesn't bite cleanly

3.5/5

***Oyster and Pork Intestine***

Good flavor I just don't like pork intestine and oysters

i'm sure it'd hit if I liked them

2.5/5

***Tang Yuan with Shaved Ice***

ice was very well shaved, actual ice not the fluffy ones which i like

infinite ice was crazy and i'd eat it again

i actually liked the lemon juice on ice, made my tongue water again thinking about it

the osmanthus syrup was also good, but only in small subtle portions


tangyuan got kinda cold sitting on the ice. to be expected but I prefer mine softer

can't usually eat that many tang yuan so the amount was perfect (for me)

3/5
