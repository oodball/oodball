    ## FOOD
    ***Watercress? with mushrooms***
    my favorite dish of the night
    perfect texture
    easy to grab
    slightly sour taste to them which was amazing
    would go back just for this dish

    4/5

    ***mentaiko udon***
    very very good also
    might be too rich if i had all the sauce on its own
    alot of sauce
    mentaiko good
    suprisingly not salty

    3.5/5

    ***Skewers***

    beef one was alright, kinda chewy

    chickens:
    one with the sauce on it was good, kept falling off though so it was a bit tiring to eat 

    salt was my favorite, very juicy chicken. had this crisp layer to it that i thought was really nice

    tbh i liked the ones at hinotez more

    2.5/5
