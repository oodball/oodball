  content: `## INTRODUCTION

  This post should have been out a long time ago but I'm using the excuse of being "too busy". I thought a lot about what I should write about this place, but I can't really find the words to say what's on my mind at the moment. I hope everybody doesn't mind. 

  I found this place after whining to Terrace Dao about craving P.L. Bagels all the time but not wanting to put in the effort to drive all the way to Point Loma. She was finally fed up with me and sent me the link to this TikTok account that exclusively tries bagels all over San Diego to see which one is the best. AI algorithms are scary.

  Since I've upgraded myself to Instagram Reels User and am so above having a TikTok account (not sponsored but open to negotiation) I painstakingly opened the link on my phone, requested the site in Desktop mode, and watched all the TikToks. 

  Suprisingly, a bagel shop in Carlsbad was one of the highest rated. And it happens to be in a location I pass by alot. Life Lesson: You can never stop learning even if you're an expert. I then meticulously planned (sent a text) to Therese and Charlotte to meet up for bagels and buy our first digicams. 

  When we got there, the parking lot was pretty open, although the bagel shop was shockingly busy for how late it was.
  
  What was a bigger shock was that someone from my high school worked there. 

  More to follow on that.

  ***HellFire Bagel***

  To be honest, I forgot to take pictures because I was too busy yapping at the excitement of seeing Charlotte and Therese again. My bad everyone. I'll be more careful next time. Probably.

  I felt anxious making a decision on what to get because I was scared of making the cashier wait when he was already talking to me so in a panic I picked up a bag of bagels that were made yesterday and pointed at the most interesting one.

  It turns out that was the Hellfire Bagel. After hearing it, I was too shy to change my mind because they already started pulling it out so I said it was fine. 

  I was going to get the rest of the bagels in the bag too to take home, but I think that he just assumed I wanted the one bagel with cream cheese, and I was too distracted to correct him until after I paid.

  I guess we made good impressions on him during high school, because he ended up giving us the rest of the bagels for free. The three of us got to split a dozen bagels that we only paid $4 for.

  It's good to have connections in high places. 

  The hellfire bagel is supposed to be made with ghost pepper and three other peppers, so I was busy preparing potential bathrooms in case it all went to ... shit ... 

  I didn't really have to worry though, because the bagel wasn't spicy, except for the residual pepper oil. That was the real hellfire.

  The bagel itself was pretty large, and it came with a generous amount of cream cheese. I don't remember too much about the taste of the bagel itself, but I remember feeling happy while eating it so it can't have been that bad. 

  Or maybe I was biased eating it with friends.


  However, after trying the free bagels at home, I realized that the bagels were very dense and chewy and the onion bagel I tried had a strange aftertaste. I prefer my bagels a little bit lighter, and to not have to work as hard to eat the bagel, especially in the morning.

  3/5

  ## OVERALL THOUGHTS

  To be honest, Inglorious Bagels wasn't as good as P.L. Bagels, but for the price (even without the discount), it was still a good deal. At least it curbed the bagel craving for a little bit. However, I'd still choose this place over P.L. Bagels simply out of convenience.

  Given proximity, location, and service, I would recommend going here if you're in North County. Maybe next time I'll try out the fresh bagels or bagel sandwiches and see if there's a difference.
