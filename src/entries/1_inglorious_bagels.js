  This post should have been out a long time ago but I'm using the excuse of being "too busy". I thought a lot about what I should write about this place, but I can't really find the words to say what's on my mind at the moment. I hope everybody doesn't mind. 

  I found this place after whining to Terrace Dao about craving P.L. Bagels all the time but not wanting to put in the effort to drive all the way to Point Loma. She was finally fed up with me and sent me the link to this TikTok account that exclusively tries bagels all over San Diego to see which one is the best. AI algorithms are scary.

  Since I've upgraded myself to Instagram Reels User and am so above having a TikTok account (not sponsored but open to negotiation) I painstakingly opened the link on my phone, requested the site in Desktop mode, and watched all the TikToks. 

  Suprisingly, a bagel shop in Carlsbad was one of the highest rated. And it happens to be in a location I pass by alot. Life Lesson: You can never stop learning even if you're an expert. I then meticulously planned (sent a text) to Therese and Charlotte to meet up for bagels and buy our first digicams. 

  When we got there, the parking lot was pretty open, although the bagel shop was shockingly busy for how late it was.
  
  What was a bigger shock was that someone from my high school worked there.

  I Made a Rookie Mistake

  To be honest, I forgot to take pictures because I was too busy yapping and getting over the fact that I knew the person working there. 

  The hellfire bagel really raised hell for my lips afterwards.
