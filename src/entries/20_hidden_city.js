    content: `## INTRODUCTION

I'd like to issue an apology for my lack of unprofessionalism. I was not paying enough attention as I should have in this restaurant, and forgot to note down which cocktail I ordered. I have went through the bar's Facebook, Instagram, and their Google reviews trying to see if I could find a picture of their menu but after twenty minutes of searching, I haven't found anything. 

I'm sorry.

I wanted to write about Hidden City first even though it doesn't match chronological order because this place left the biggest impression this trip. Even with all the fancy places that we visited, or the good food that we ate, my mind keeps coming back to the time I spent inside this bar. 

While all of Taipei felt so busy and lively, entering Hidden City instantly shifted the mood into a safe, intimate setting. Like when you feel so overwhelmed with thoughts and something is able to quiet it all down.

I believe this is because there's nobody to break an illusionment when you first walk in. There were no customers on the first floor. There was no bartender or greeter asking you how many people were in your party. There's truly nothing to break your initial wonder at walking in until you're ready to break it yourself by opening the upstairs door to the bar. Currently, what greets you is just an empty room, with directions to head up the stairs. 

Silence without any expectations is the strongest form of intimacy. And Hidden City had been able to create it.

***My Cocktail***

Usually when I drink, I like sticking to the flavors that I already know that I like. Sour, fruity, something with tequila, things that I've had before. I like ordering basics, because if each bar has them, I'm able to compare them easier. I recently realized that's kinda boring of me to do, so I want to switch it up this time. 

The bartender described this drink as a Thai twist on a Bloody Mary. There's tomato juice, clarified green papaya, and sriracha. This drink could be the worst drink I've ever had, but it sounded so interesting I kept flipping back to this cocktail while looking through the menu.

Never stop gambling.

I've never felt so much flavor come out of a cocktail before. The drink has a very heavy tangy tomato taste at first, then it shifts into something sweeter that I couldn't place. The drink was refreshing, and as it went down, the burn from the sriracha hit my throat as an aftertaste.

It was the best cocktail I've had. 

4.5/5

***Oden***

To be honest, I didn't pay that much attention to the oden. I remember each item was flavorful and each bite was great, but I can't provide an in depth analysis to flavor proviles or textures because I was simply just enjoying my time in the bar. 

The broth was very enjoyable as well. It was a good reset for me to enjoy the rest of my drink.

3/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I really enjoyed my time at Hidden City. I felt present, and connected. The bartenders were attentive to every small shift in attitude of their customers. You can tell they take great pride in their creations. Even when I stepped away for just a short moment, the bartender had already taken my drink and put it in the fridge to keep cool so the ice didn't dilute my drink.

Maybe I should become a bartender.
