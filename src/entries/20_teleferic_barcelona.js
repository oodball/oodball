    content: `## INTRODUCTION

I was going through all my pictures and remembered that I forgot to write about this one. Which is a pain considering I've never logged anything in the bay and never logged any Spanish food either. Is it performative of me to want to log different places?

Anyways this is a PSA for anyone who comes here: Bring your resume. Airdrop it to whoever is in this restaurant and I bet at least one of them works in tech. If you don't want to work in tech, bring your dating profile. I'm sure there's someone here for you. 

(And they'll be rich)

Barcelona Teleferic is located right next to Stanford University. It's really upscale

## FOOD

***Tuna Carpaccio***

I'm gonna be honest, this tasted fine. I'm not surprised it tasted fine because there's quite literally little to no preparation needed for this besides presentation. You could have just slapped a tomato and some tuna on a plate and gotten the same result.

Besides the fact that there was just some vinegar on the side, there's no way they could have messed this one up. None of the ingredients need cooking, so all you have to do is put it on a plate and spread it thin so it looks like you're getting served more than you actually are. 

I used to really like flowers all over my food and stuff, but I'm realizing that whatever Chef Ahn said in culinary class wars about how everything on the plate should be edible or it's useless crap on the plate was right. Why should I have to navigate around a plate that has things I can't eat?

I ate it anyways. It didn't taste good.

I'm convinced that they intentionally made the tomato and the tuna blend together because you can't tell how much tuna you're getting until you bite into it and realize you've been tricked.

2/5

***Iberico Ham***

Every year I get tempted by that big Iberico ham leg they sell with the hanger at Costco for the holidays, so I've always wanted to try it.

I know that this really doesn't take much prep at all either. It's not like they dry the pig in the backrooms of the kitchens or anything, so I don't credit the restaurant with the taste at all.

But it did taste good. 

Salty, but good. 

Any type of cured meat is always good. I'm not sure if I can tell the difference between this and any other cured ham though.

3.5/5

***Mojito Oysters***

These oysters were fishy. Which isn't that surprising because raw oysters are usually fishy.

To be honest, they just looked fancy. The oysters were pretty big and juicy, and the flavor was alright, but nothing particularly stood out. I'm pretty sure there was still leftover sand or something in them too, because I bit into something hard. 

2.5/5


***Paella Negra***

![paella](/images/Foodball/teleferic_barcelona/paella_negra.jpg "A Surprise is Waiting")

This dish surprised me the most when it came out. We went to this place specifically for the paella, since it's been on my mind to try it for a while. While we were up in the bay, it seemed like the best time to go splurge a bit. 

I was disappointed. Here's why.

I sank the spoon into the pan to grab a big scoop. Only, I didn't get a big scoop.

It was just a thin layer of rice made to look good. They said it would feed 3-4 people. I probably could have eaten that on my own. 

The flavor was very rich though. It was very buttery, and the flavors meshed well together. 

I felt a bit scammed still. 

3/5


## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I think you should only come here if you feel like your wallet is overflowing and you don't know what to do with the money. I'm sure you can find cheaper paella and tapas places elsewhere. Or just make it at home and you can probably get more out of it. 
    
Or come here if you want to be someone's sugar baby. You'd probably find that here too.
