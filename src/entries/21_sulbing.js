content: `## INTRODUCTION

I feel like I'm starting to understand the life of a fanfic writer. Especially those who don't update for 5 years only to come back and leave crazy author's notes. The "I went to prison bc my dad beat me up and I retaliated then I got into a car accident but I suddenly had alot more free time so enjoy this chappy" writers.

It's been a long time Foodball. I wonder if anyone still reads these. 

This post is going to make me look so big. And it's because I cheated. These posts were actually made over the course of my trip in Seoul where we just happened to get this particular shaved ice store three times. We did not eat all of it in one night.

No comments about big backs.

## FOOD

**Melon Hwachae Bingsu**

My favorite out of the three Bingsu we had from this place. I'm not a fan of honeydew or cantaloupe, but I love watermelon.

This bingsu was so refreshing. Every bite was juicy because of the fruit, and it was a very nice refresher after a big KBBQ dinner (foreshadowing).

I think the addition of ice cream inside the bingsu was a bit much. The entire dish was pretty soupy since it's topped with fruit and it came with the soda already for the hwachae, so it was a bit much to have melting ice cream on top of my melting ice. 

The ice cream didn't get in the way of the actual flavors itself, but I think that it was a bit hard to finish because of how much heavier it made the dessert. 


3.5/5

**Red Bean Injeolmi Bingsu**

This bingsu was too sweet for me. I've never wanted more water in my life. Usually, red bean makes me want to drink alot of water because of the texture and sweetness, but the addition of injeolmi made me imagine life in the Sahara.

This bingsu is a safety hazard. Each bite of the bingsu came with injeolmi that just sat on top of the ice. It would be better if it were a paste after sitting on top of the ice, but it seemed to just float on top. 

Good for aesthetics, not for eating.

The injeolmi itself tasted fine, but I would have preferred a different method of putting it in. Maybe make the ice itself injeolmi flavored instead of putting it on top. 

2.5/5



**Tiramisu Bingsu**

I had high expectations. 

We left the land of the free in search of good tiramisu. We were promised good tiramisu by Taiwan. Taiwan lied. We hoped Korea could make up for it. 

Korea stabbed us 50 times in the gut and then spat on us and kicked us to the streets.

The actual shaved ice was fine. I wasn't expecting much for this because I already knew the texture would be nice and fluffy. 

The Koreans are strangely obsessed with bringing back the Cinnamon Challenge though. The layer of cocoa powder was laid on super thick, just like the injeolmi from the red bean bingsu. I would have liked to enjoy my bingsu. Instead we were learning techniques to not choke on the powder.

We had moved aside the tiramisu ahead of time to get it out of the way of the shaved ice. It's concerning how easy it was to move.

It was also super dense. And frozen. Like it's been in the fridge since 2019. 

It was a very disappointing attempt at a tiramisu.

2/5

 Building a House with this Abomination


## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I love bingsu still. I tend to go for the fruity ones because I like pretending that I'm eating something healthy when I'm not. I think that Sulbing is worth it, but be very mindful of what you're ordering, because you could be buying the next brick for your house.

This place was definitely more trendy for aesthetics, but the flavor profile was pretty good too.
