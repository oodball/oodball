I feel like I'm starting to understand the life of a fanfic writer. Especially those who don't update for 5 years only to come back and leave crazy author's notes. The "I went to prison bc my dad beat me up and I retaliated then I got into a car accident but I suddenly had alot more free time so enjoy this chappy" writers.

It's been a long time Foodball. I wonder if anyone still reads these. 

This post is going to make me look so big. And it's because I cheated. These posts were actually made over the course of 9 days in Seoul where we just happened to get this particular shaved ice store three times. We did not eat all of it in one night.

## FOOD

**Melon Hwachae Bingsu**

My favorite out of the three Bingsu we had from this place. I'm not a fan of honeydew or cantaloupe, but I love watermelon.

This bingsu was so refreshing. Every bite was juicy

**Red Bean Injeolmi Bingsu**

This bingsu was too sweet for me. I've never wanted more water in my life. Usually, red bean makes me want to drink alot of water because of the texture and sweetness, but the addition of injeolmi made me imagine life in the Sahara.

This bingsu is a safety hazard. Each bite of the bingsu

2.5/5



**Tiramisu Bingsu**

I had high expectations. 

We left the land of the free in search of good tiramisu. We were promised good tiramisu by Taiwan. Taiwan lied. We hoped Korea could make up for it. 

Korea stabbed us 50 times in the gut and then spat on us and kicked us to the streets.

The actual shaved ice was fine. I wasn't expecting much for this because I already knew the texture would be nice and fluffy. 

I'm not sure why Koreans are obsessed with bringing back the Cinnamon Challenge in different fonts though. The layer of cocoa powder was laid on super thick, just like the injeolmi from the red bean bingsu. I would have liked to enjoy my bingsu.

We had moved aside the tiramisu ahead of time to get it out of the way of the shaved ice. I'm concerned that it was that easy to move. 

It was also super dense. And frozen. Like it's been in the fridge since 2019. 

It was a very disappointing attempt at a tiramisu.

2/5
