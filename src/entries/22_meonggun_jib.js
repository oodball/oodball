    content: `## INTRODUCTION

Do I have a midterm on Friday? 

Yes. 

Did I suddenly coincidentally get an intense urge to give a short Foodball update? 

Also yes.

Meonggun Jib is supposedly only a place that locals know. Figures since we got the recommendation from some local girl that HimeTsai met at the bar. How open-minded of me.

When we walked in, it was clear that we (tourists) weren't supposed to be the target audience. The staff panicked trying to find someone to speak English, and the only menu was just handwritten letters on the wall. 

We only ate one dish the entire night...

## FOOD

Fortunately for us, we had exactly one person that could speak English well enough with us. He ended up cooking all of our meat for us because he said there's a specific way to cook it that makes the locals love this place so much.

He sounded so knowledgable that I asked him where else he recommended in Seoul. 

He said he didn't know. 

He was Vietnamese.

Xin chao chingu.

***Pork Belly***

I was so invested in talking to our server and eating the food that I forgot to take a picture.

To be honest, I can't tell pork belly qualities apart. I know that there's ones with too much fat, too little fat, and also the way it just tastes.

I still remember the way this pork belly tasted. Even without seasoning, it was juicy and flavorful, but with their house made seasoning, which Mr. Vietnam also made for us, it tasted so good. 

Also, I appreciate raw garlic with my KBBQ on a new level now. For some reason, the garlic in Korea isn't spicy. But my gut health was probably so detoxed by the way I was eating that garlic.

Obviously since the food is so heavy, I did end up getting a bit sick of the pork belly over time. I wanted to eat another bite so badly, but there was too much oil for me to be able to enjoy it properly.

This was the best KBBQ spot we went to in the entire trip. 

5/5
    
    
## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I highly recommend going here. The staff are friendly even though they can't understand you, and it seems like all of them really like working there. Our waiter took great pride in his work, and was very vocal about how good their sauce was and how they cook their meat.

That confidence wasn't misplaced. He knew exactly how much chili pepper to put in to make it perfect. This is the first place I'd run back to next time I'm in Korea.

They even sprayed laundry spray on us when we left so we didn't smell like KBBQ.
