Hey Oodballsnacks,

At the ripe old age of 22, I've finally embraced having a caffeine adiction.

Grad school ruins you.

So in celebration of this, I've been drinking more coffee and tea later and later into the day, and that means I have more time in the day to enjoy the drinks without it negatively affecting my sleep schedule.

Not that it really can considering I'm writing this at 2 AM right now.

Like I said, grad school ruins you.

Labora is connected to Urbn Bubble in Convoy. Parking is really ass here, since there's really only 20 parking spots for 5 businesses in the same area. Also given that it's finals time and all the students are filling up cafe spots for 6 hours and only buying one drink, you have to be really lucky to find parking.

It's a pretty small place, but they maximize the space enough to put in cozy study spaces.

When Hannah and I went, there were only kids on Canvas cramming for some final or another, so it's clear that Labora is doing something right with their marketing.

***Pandan Matcha***
To be honest, I didn't really like this drink when I first tasted it. The pandan taste was strong enough to be bitter, and it gave a weird aftertaste to the matcha. 

I even offered it to Hannah.

Good thing she didn't take it though, because I really enjoyed the drink when the ice melted.

The matcha was well concentrated, but I don't think I could concentrate on it because the pandan taste was really strong.

After the ice melted, I think that the subtle taste of the pandan blended better with the matcha, but at that point, I really wanted a heavier concentration of matcha, which had diluted by then. I can't really fault them for that because I left it overnight and let all the ice melt instead of drinking it right away.

Even though I say that though, I think that the pandan is a good addition to matcha.

3.5/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

If you're a matcha enthusiast, I think this place would be a nice try for you. I think that in terms of matcha, the only place that beats this out is Hinar that I've tried so far.

I'll be better in the future and try more matcha places for my dedicated performative fans.
