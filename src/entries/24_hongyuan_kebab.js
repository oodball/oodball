    content: `## INTRODUCTION

I was suddenly inspired to write another entry after going to the zoo today. Seeing all those animals made me really hungry.

Hongyuan Kebab has terrible parking. As Convoy usually does. But this one is actually terrible because this parking lot is a lawless land.

And I still found parking. 

Anything for Foodball.

## FOOD
***Skewers***

To be completely honest, there isn't much to say about the Skewers. They were nicely cooked I guess? I like that they cooked our pork belly skewers separately because I definitely would have undercooked them. I was impatient and I just really wanted to eat.

The pork belly wrapped around enoki mushrooms were probably the best since they were super juicy, but I wouldn't say it stood out too much to me. 

The real star was the sauces that we were given. 

There was a standard Chinese chili pepper seasoning for the skewers that was really good, and then there was this sour chili sauce that made all the skewers taste really good. I couldn't figure out what was in it, but it tasted similar to a mix of the chili and vinegar they give you with Korean Naengmyeon. 

I think the meat quality didn't live up to my expectations. I noticed that more often than not, I was eating straight pieces of fat on the skewers instead of actual meat. I know some restaurants put fat pieces between the meat in order to keep the meat juicy while cooking, but it felt like penalty with not much reward.

At least the taste was fine.

***Deep-fried Mushrooms***

These were actually the best dish of the night. When the menu said they were deep-fried, I was expecting to only eat a few because I get tired of very oily things.

I couldn't stop eating this.

The breading on the mushrooms was so unbelievably thin that it didn't feel like they were fried at all. Also, paired with the skewer dipping sauces, it was so good. 

Could I probably make these at home? Yes. But that doesn't mean they didn't do it well.

5/5

***Scallion Pancake***

These aren't the same Scallion Pancakes I'm used to eating. These felt much more deep fried and were much thicker and flakier than the usual. I'm not sure if it was a Korean style Pajeon or a Chinese style scallion pancake, but it was pretty good. 

I think I'd get sick of it too quickly though. The flakiness was amazing, but that also means that there was a heavy amount of oil that went into making it. Paired with all the other fried things on the table, I think that it was good that we split this dish.

3/5

***Tangsuyuk***

The flavor on this dish was amazing. There was just enough sourness and just enough sweetness within this sweet and sour pork. Compared to the one that I ate in Korea, this one was so much better. The sauce coating the fried pork didn't make the fried bits soggy, which is the number 1 thing I hate. The breading was very crunchy, and the way the dough was made, which was different than the mushroom fried dough, made sure that there were bigger chunks of fried dough stuck together. These helped the sauce stick to more areas, and made the pork really juicy.

The only complaint I have is that the sauce had too much sugar in it to the point where it created a taffy sort of texture when I ate it. It made it really annoying to eat since every time I took a bite, little bits of sugar kept getting stuck to my teeth, which felt pretty uncomfortable.

Even with the inconvenience, I'd still order it again. This place had the best Tangsuyuk I've had in San Diego.

3.75/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I'm still trying to figure out if this place was Korean or Chinese... All of the staff and parts of the menu were very Chinese, but also their logo was in Korean and half thier dishes were also Chinese/Korean fusion dishes. 

The food was good, but the only dish that stood out to me were the mushrooms and maybe the Tangsuyuk. I don't think I have very much reason to come back since it's pretty pricy, parking is ass, and the meat quality was just decent.

However it's definitely a place to keep in mind as a second-choice restaurant.
