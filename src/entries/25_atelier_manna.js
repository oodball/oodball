## INTRODUCTION

It's now 2026 and I'm realizing the extent of my procrastination, so Happy New Year to everybody and I'm hoping to update Foodball more consistently so that I have more and more fans.

Anyways.

Atelier Manna has been on the list for a while now, and we only just decided to go recently. 

I was really intrigued because they said they were a Michelin Guide restaurant, and I've heard many things about it. I heard that it's really good, that the line goes out the door, and that the food was pretty pricy.

The people (Google Reviews) don't lie.
## FOOD

***Çılbır: Turkish Poached Eggs***

I think I saw the God of cooking in this dish.

Everything about it is just perfection. From the chili crisps, which provided a nice break in the creamy texture, to the subtle herbs in the yogurt which was just sour enough to cut through the oil in the eggs, there's not a single thing I can say that will change my mind that this was the best thing I've had in a long time.

I can't say anything more. Everything, including plating and presentation, was perfection.

5/5

***Torrijas- French Toast***

This was less than perfection.

There's this initial wow factor in seeing the dish, but it felt like it was just peacocking around and there wasn't any real depth behind it. 

I got sick of this dish quite literally seconds after biting into it. The yuzu cheesecake was just too much with the extra carbs in the bread, and there was some cream that was making me feel like I was biting into an uncomfortably wet diaper. Not that I've done that, but if there was ever a feeling, that'd be it.

When they say thick cut, they really mean it. And since it was so thick cut, it was a huge hassle to cut and share it with everyone, because there's no way you'll ever finish it on your own. It was entirely too sweet, and there were unnecessary inedible things like the decorative leaves on top.

It's super heavy and rich, so it's definitely not for the Asian palatte.

Too sweet.

1.5/5


## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I want to go back to this place and try out other dishes. I feel like the Torrijas was a dumpster fire, but the Turkish eggs were so good that I need to go back and try another salty item off their menu to see if it's truly worth it. 

I'd return just to eat the Turkish eggs any day, but I'd need to be super rich if I did that.
