## INTRODUCTION

When Ms. Hong asks if you're free in two days, you have to prepare yourself. 

On figuring out where to eat. Because we're big and have been a bunch of places already.

The atmosphere was very bright and summery when we got there. It's right along the 101, which means that there isn't parking most of the time, but the place will be cute. It's very hard to find a place along the 101 in Encinitas that isn't all decorated. 

I was right. Most of the tables are set up outside in this semi-courtyartish setup, and there's a line going out the door since it's a place where you order at the counter before you sit down and find a table.

For a place that doesn't have a parking lot, this place was packed.

***Iced Cherry Matcha***

This drink is a part of the special seasonal menu.

I don't recommend it. Personally it didn't have a strong matcha taste, and I didn't appreciate the little bits of cherry that were floating around in my drink. The matcha didn't taste as good quality-wise as other matchas, and it was more expensive than I wanna admit.

2/5

***Leucadian Benedict***
