## INTRODUCTION

When Ms. Hong asks if you're free in two days, you have to prepare yourself. 

On figuring out where to eat. Because we're big and have been a bunch of places already.

The atmosphere was very bright and summery when we got there. It's right along the 101, which means that there isn't parking most of the time, but the place will be cute. It's very hard to find a place along the 101 in Encinitas that isn't all decorated. 

I was right. Most of the tables are set up outside in this semi-courtyartish setup, and there's a line going out the door since it's a place where you order at the counter before you sit down and find a table.

For a place that doesn't have a parking lot, this place was packed.
    
## FOOD

***Iced Cherry Matcha***

This drink is a part of the special seasonal menu.

I don't recommend it. Personally it didn't have a strong matcha taste, and I didn't appreciate the little bits of cherry that were floating around in my drink. The matcha didn't taste as good quality-wise as other matchas, and it was more expensive than I wanna admit.

2/5

***Leucadian Benedict***

The thing that surprised me most about this dish was the sauce on top of the eggs benedict. It was cheesy, eggy, but also had some mysterious flavor in it that made it complement the eggs better than any other sauce I've had with this dish before. The eggs and sauce flowed well and coated the hash browns with a nice coating before I got to eat them, but they still somehow maintained crunchiness. 


I feel like avocado was useless in this dish besides some nice garnish. I don't mind it, but I feel like it was just in the way of the other food, and you had to eat it all if you planned on having leftovers because next-day avocado looks like your dog just ruined your breakfast the next day...

If it played a bigger part in how the dish tasted overall I wouldn't have minded it, but it felt like it was just there to provide some color in a small corner of the dish. 

4/5



## OVERALL THOUGHTS

I liked the food here. I tried bites of the chicken an waffles and the chimichurry steak bowl and both of those were very good too. The only thing I don't recommend is buying the drinks. They were overpriced and underdelivered, which was the only setback to this place.
