## INTRODUCTION

I love ice cream. I love San Diego. I love being able to eat ice cream in December. 

Somehow even with all that I've never been to any of the An's franchises.

Considering they're #1 in the country for their ice cream, I finally had an excuse to go to An's after using my precious zoo membership and scheming to make as many people as possible get a membership.

Current Pyramid Scheme Success Count: 4

We specifically went to An's Dry Cleaning because of their Tongue Pop 
    
## FOOD

***Tongue Pop***

I was immediately interested in this flavor when looking it up online. It may or may not have been the reason we went to this location instead of Hatmaker's in Del Mar. 


Instnatly, Mango, Raspberry, and Mint

***Palette Cleanser***

Lime and Ginger

This isn't even technically one of their flavors. They hand this to you right before they take you through la

***Hot Apple Cider***
