    ## FOOD

    ***Chicken Karaage w/ Jalapeno Lime Sauce***

    octopus tender
    very easy to eat

    very delish

    portion was tiny was more 4.5/5

    ***Curry Katsu***

    dry
    ends hard to chew, felt silly eating

    dry

    curry sauce too salty

    bamboozled by large dish small rice

    2.5/5
