  content: `## INTRODUCTION

  I've been meaning to try this place for a long long time. Ever since Himetsai wouldn't stop talking about how he wants to go to Mitch's seafood, I've had it on my mental checklist. It's too bad that it took us this long to get there.

  The main problem with getting there is that it's far. Even with a car, I have to want to eat Mitch's enough to drive the 30 min from La Jolla it takes to get there. Not to mention the extra time it takes to get to La Jolla. San Diego sucks to commute around if you're like me and want good food close by.

  Since Himetsai is leaving soon, we decided to put together a food tour of all the places we wanted to try before he leaves, and this was on the list. We decided to drive there early, hoping to beat all the lines because we were starving. When we got there, I made the decision of skipping over a parking spot.
  
  Rookie mistake. 

  We spent the next half an hour circling the parking lot before I parked in a 20 min zone. The line at Mitch's was already lined up out the door and around a corner. 

  I got too anxious about getting ticketed so I circled another 15 min to find parking. Hime is lucky to be a passenger princess.
  
  ## FOOD

  ***Clam Chowder***

  This dish is the one thing we came to Mitch's for. Himetsai kept glazing the clam chowder that I had to go see if he was really telling the truth or not. We're both really picky about clam chowder. 

  Himetsai was right. The soup flavor was perfect. The soup was just the right consistency of thick, but not overly thick, and the potatoes were perfectly cooked so they weren't disintegrating into the soup. While those were great, the ratio of clam to chowder was perfect. Each bite had an appropriate amount of clam, which is hard to find in this economy. 

  The one problem I had with it was that there were too many veggies in the soup. I also wish there were more oyster crackers that were provided, but that might be a personal preference rather than one made to critique the dish. 

  Hime keeps insisting that the Taiwan Costco has better Clam Chowder though. We'll have to try that one eventually (foreshadowing).

  ***Fish Sandwich***

  I wasn't really up to try any fried seafood this time with all the heavy food I'd been eating the entire week. I decided to get a fish sandwich thinking it'd be a good option for someone who doesn't like seafood that much.

  The first bite was delicious. The bread was perfectly crunchy. The fish fell apart nicely with the sandwich, and the spread on the bread made the fish really juicy. I'm not one to eat grilled fish straight up, but even I knew this was a quality piece of fish. 

  That was it though, it went downhill from there. 

  The fish became dry no matter how much lemon or spread there was. I started experimenting with malt vinegar, different types of hot sauce, and even dunked it into the Fisherman's Stew, but the taste quickly got old and I was over the sandwich by the first half. The last half was a team effort, mostly on my part. 

  I liked how big the portion size was. If I didn't eat the clam chowder beforehand, I'm sure I would have been able to finish, but I had to ditch the bread by the second half to finish the fish. However, the sandwich was hard to eat because there was too much filling. Oh, the pain of being too successful.

  2/5

  ***Fisherman's Stew***

  I'm not a seafood person. 

  The soup base was good, but overall too fishy for my taste.

  It helped with getting the fish sandwich down though.

  2.5/5

  ## OVERALL THOUGHTS

  I would go back just for the clam chowder alone. I think next time I'd order one of the fried baskets, since most people looked like they were ordering that. The food here is pretty mid, but it might just be because of my seafood bias.

  Considering total commute time including finding parking, standing in line, and waiting for food, we spent around 2 hours just doing that. I don't think it's worth enough to do that on a normal basis, especially since you have to pay for parking as well.

  The food itself seemed pretty reasonably priced.
