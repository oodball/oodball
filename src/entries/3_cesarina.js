  content: `## INTRODUCTION
  Even though it's out of order, this is going to be the first review that I'm going to fully write out for this page. I intended Foodball to be more a food blog page, but you guys will probably just get a shitpost intro about the day too. BOGO deal, what a steal. 
  
  I want to structure it this way because it would be meaningless to talk about food without having some emotional weight behind it. Obviously there's a simple whether I like the food or not, but I want a place to word vomit so whatever. And if you're wondering why I started with Cesarina even though it's not rated that well, it's simply just because this is was the last fancy dinner Himetsai and I reserved together before he left and I don't want to be sad so I'm writing about it. That and I was looking forward to this dinner since we made a reservation and not just a last minute decision.
  
  The parking is terrible in Ocean Beach. The place itself is a small corner next to a pizza place, so I didn't even realize when I drove past it until Himetsai told me to turn in (I didn't). At least me trying to find my way back to Cesarina gave time for a customer to drive off from their spot right in the alley next to the restaurant. It was all calculated.

  Having a face card is required to work at Cesarina. Everybody working the front of the house was young and conventionally good looking. How pretentious. Then they asked us if we wanted "house-filtered water". It tasted like regular water. It came out of a fun chicken pitcher so that made it feel better. Still pretentious.

  I appreciated the effort into restaurant decor though. The outdoor patio had real plants growing and nice lighting. Definitely a place to take aesthetic photos. The plates and pitchers were also really nice. Each plate was different and matched the atmosphere well.

  ## FOOD

  ***Bread Basket***

  They gave us a bread basket along with their house-made salsa as soon as we sat down. I think it was focaccia but there were two types of bread. One of them was a bit more orange and flat than the other one. IMO, it didn't really hit like other bread. The bread felt kind of stale and it was way too chewy, even for my standards. The salsa was good, but nothing noteable. I saved some bread to clean up the pasta sauces.
  
  2.5/5

  ***Tartufone Sauce with Fettucine***

  When they first brought this dish out I felt a bit jealous because Ray ordered it and I thought his looked better than mine did. The first thing I noticed was the expensive smell of truffles. Eating this will let me learn how to rich-man laugh.

  The first bite I took was incredible. The sauce was a bit grainy which I was suprised by since I thought it'd be smoother, but the taste was really rich and creamy. The pasta was perfectly al dente and had a bounce back to it that I really liked.

  And then I was over it.

  I usually really like white sauces and how creamy and heavy they were, but this overdid it. The taste quickly turned old and the sauce became too grainy, too oily. Every bite after the second one required mental willpower.

  2.5/5


  ***Bolognese with Gemelli***

  I wasn't really expecting much from this dish since bolognese is just a meat sauce, but I was pretty surprised by this one. It looked pretty standard, and the only thing that was different was adding a sprig of rosemary on top of a quirky plate.

  But the sauce was really good. It was a little more sour than other bolognese sauces I tried but it felt refreshing, especially after eating the Tartufone pasta. I ended up switching between the two dishes alot because I could use the bolognese to offset the heaviness of the other one. I'm not sure if I enjoyed this dish more because the other one took so much effort to eat, but I liked it. It doesn't stand out compared to any other bolognese sauces (even storebought).

  What did stand out though was the pasta. It was just as al dente as the other pasta, but I liked the shape of it. When I saw Gemelli pasta, I thought it was just one of those standard boxed twisted pasta shapes, which I was completely fine with, but this gemelli shape had deep pockets that picked up the sauce really well. Each bite had a good ratio of sauce to pasta.

  3.5/5

  ***Tiramisu***

  ![Tiramisu](/images/Foodball/cesarina/cesarina_tiramisu.jpg "Whole Foods Tiramisu Doesn't Look Like This")

  This was the most hyped-up item (source:Reddit) of the night.  I was looking forward to this bc you all know I fuck with a good tiramisu. 

  Nobody told me it was tableside made right at the table tiramisu. I've never had one of those before, but I've always been looking forward to it. Seeing this at the other tables made me jealous. At one point I stopped Ray from going to the bathroom bc our tiramisu was almost here and I wanted him here to watch it with me. I guess I was speaking too loud because now the waitress was giving us tiramisu ETA and was also asking Ray if he wanted to go to the bathroom. My bad.

  I became a middle-aged Asian lady when that waiter arrived. I had my phone out ready to record and everything. 

  I think that Whole Foods tiramisu is better. And cheaper. 

  However, it was still a good experience. The mascarpone tasted really good, and the coffee kept me from falling asleep on the way home. However, the coffee didn't soak through the lady fingers enough, so I kept getting chunks of either really soggy or suspiciously crunchy biscuit. The taste was well balanced, and the coffee came through really well when I had it. The fact that it wasn't chilled either though threw me off since it wasn't as firm as tiramisu usually is.

  3/5

  My Evolution into a Middle-Aged Lady

  ## OVERALL THOUGHTS

  Overhyped. Underperformed. The customer service was great and the presentation of everything made you feel super fancy, but in reality, the food was just mid. I don't think it was worth it for the price we paid.

  Final Rating: 2.9/5
