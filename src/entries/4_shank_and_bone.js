To be honest, I debated on putting out this one because I had such negative thoughts going into the restaurant that I wonder if it affected my rating of this restaurant. However, my taste buds don't lie so I'm putting it out anyways. 

This place sucked to get to. I'm not a fan of driving around North Park, but Himetsai and I planned to go look for camcorders, and so we went to several different shops in the area. Who knew that camcorders are so obsolete. Not a single camera shop had them.

Our last shop was George's Camera, and I was already feeling pretty annoyed for several reasons. The main one being that I got stuck in heavy traffic so it took me 40 min to get from La Jolla to North Park, which is ridiculous. And Himetsai was doing his best to annoy me the entire way there.

Shank and Bone sounds like a very poorly disguised innuendo honestly. But we remembered that it was just down the street of the camera shop, so we decided to try it out since I wanted Vietnamese food. 

Parking is shit. As it is everywhere in North Park.

When we went in, the first red flag to me was that there was motorcycle decor everywhere. Why does a Vietnamese place have Arizona license plates and **multiple** motorbikes on display? Where's my classic glass fish tank with the bubbles?

## FOOD

  ***Banh Mi with Pho Broth***
  
  Finding out about this dish improved my mood a little because I was craving banh mi and pho. I've never seen anyone use the broth as a dipping sauce, and I figured if the Mexicans have birria, then this has to also hit the same.

  The one thing that I can confidently say for this dish is that it is not tailored to people who have had a banh mi before. The banh mi was super small, with not much filling inside. There were no pickled vegetables. There were also grilled onions inside the banh mi. No banh mi ever has had grilled onions in it. It brought my mood back down. 

  Also the fact that there was basil and the jalapeno set on the side instead??? Why is there supposed to be basil in my banh mi??

  If the banh mi confused me, the pho broth confused me more. If that's even possible.

  The pho broth was sweet. Not like the umami-rich ones at other pho places, but it was mostly sweet. I'm not sure if this is a regional thing, or if it's a catering to a certain target demographic.

  1.5/5

  ***Canh chua tôm***

  I'm not really sure how this is supposed to taste, since I've never had it before. It's braised catfish with a soup on the side.

  The rice was good at least. 

  I'm not a big fan of seafood as you all may have known by now, but the catfish was nicely cooked and fell apart easily.  

  The main thing I keep saying about this place is that the food is sweet. The catfish was extra sweet, like it was cooked in syrup. Personally I wouldn't get this again. 

  The soup was sweet yet sour at the same time. I think they used the pho broth as a base for the soup, then added in a couple more sour elements. I liked this broth a little more than the pho, so I started dipping my banh mi in here instead. However, the small bits of sourness didn't mask the underlying sweetness. 

  2/5

  ## OVERALL THOUGHTS

  I wouldn't go here again even if someone paid for my meal. The food was overpriced, it was hard to find a place to park, and the food just wasn't good. It felt like the restaurant was trying too hard to be trendy and cute. And there's an added sweetness to every single dish that made my taste buds numb.

  I thought the sweetness was a regional flavor difference, but I'm disappointed after reading the article of the owner's interview basically calling the restaurant "Vietnamese but not." I appreciate their menu being more diverse and allowing me to try more things, but the execution just wasn't there.
