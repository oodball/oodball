Today we get to do my first out-of-country food entry. (Yay)

My first impression of Montreal is that I don't like it. But not because I don't like the French. I still don't like the French but I don't like Montreal because things kept breaking. When I deplaned we got off onto this bus that Bus Driver refused to drive because the weight distribution would cause the bus to tip over. 

Personally, more of a concern that a bus built like that passes any sort of government regulation.

And then we got to the terminal. 

I got a warm welcome from the airport. In the form of a very loud gate alarm. And so I walked as fast as I could to the exit. Thankfully there was one of those automatic walkways to get away quicker. 

Sike. It was also broken. 

Anyways.

When you look at Chez Lionel, you can hear the money draining from your account. It's located in the lobby of a skyscraper that I think is a corporate office building right in the middle of downtown Montreal. The restaurant has mood lighting, candlelit tables, and everyone is dressed up in semi-formal outfits. 

Not us. We're in cargo shorts and t-shirts. Definitely not the target demographic. 

The atmosphere of the restaurant felt very much classic French fine dining. Most people seemed to be there for a work dinner or going on a nice date. There are candles lit on the table, multiple forks, water glasses AND wine glasses (serious business). 

## FOOD

***Bread Basket and Pickles***
![Chez Lionel Bread](/images/Foodball/chez_lionel/chez_lionel_bread.JPG "Regular Bread, Fancier Basket")

There isn't much to say about the bread. It didn't stand out to me, which can be taken as good or bad. It was served in a fancier than normal basket with some butter, but both of them were just there to fill the table while our food was being prepared. At least it was unlimited.

3/5

![Chez Lionel Pickles](/images/Foodball/chez_lionel/chez_lionel_pickles.JPG "Above Average-Sized Pickles")

What really suprised me was that every table got their own jar of pickles. You know how much I love pickles. This immediately improved my rating of this restaurant. The pickles were good, but it was just an ordinary pickle. 

What I do have to say is about the thoughtfulness of the restaurant. I was initially confused about the pickle jar, but it was a very good palette cleanser. With all the cheese, carbs, and meat that was in each dish, I was getting really sick of all the tastes in my mouth. At the time, I thought I was being smart by using them as a reset button, but it turns out I was the one who got played all along. What a sheep. 

I wonder what happens to all the uneaten pickles... 

3/5
***Escargot***
![Chez Lionel Escargot](/images/Foodball/chez_lionel/chez_lionel_escargot.JPG "Bop or Flop: We'll Find Out")

There's three possible things that happen when you ask a waiter for their recommendations:
<ul>
    <li>It's the most expensive thing on the menu</li>
    <li>You find out who has shit taste</li>
    <li>You remember the food for years</li>
</ul>

Mr. Montreal Waiter has good taste.

The escargot is (surprisingly) going to be the highest rated dish on Foodball.com for the forseeable future. The snails were already out of their shell, and it was cooked up in a cast iron pan with some pesto and cheese and served with bread. The dish was very shareable and easy to eat, which is the biggest thing I appreciated. There was no need to make the escargot look nice in their shell simply for presentation. 

Other than the simplicity of it, the taste of the dish itself was well done. Each ingredient was well-measured to harmonize flawlessly with the other ingredients. I worried that the pesto would be too salty, but I wasn't overpowered by it at all. The escargot was nice and tender, without the overcooked chewiness I absolutely hate.

The bread was toasted to perfection. While on its own, it might be too abrasive and hard, the pesto and oils were able to soften it up to a point where it was perfectly crunchy. 

If I had to pick out one flaw, it was that there was too much cheese on the dish. While I usually love my food with a lot of cheese, there was already enough oil inside the pan, with the pesto and the buttered bread. Having all that cheese add more oil into it seemed like overkill.

4.5/5

***Duck Confit***

I regret not taking a picture of this dish when it came out. The presentation of this dish was the best one tonight, but I got too hungry waiting and decided to eat it before remembering to take a picture. That was unprofessional of me, my bad.

This was the best duck confit I've ever had. The duck was perfectly cooked and juicy on its own, and perfectly salty. Usually I don't like ordering duck confit because the duck comes out dry and it makes me tired of eating it really quickly, but I had the opposite problem with this one. There was a salad base with thick bacon bits underneath it capturing all the juices that came from the duck and bacon, which elevated the salad dressing. 

While the dish was one of the best I've had on this Canada trip, I think that the sauce surrounding the salad and duck was too sour. The salad dressing already had enough sourness to it, so pairing the sourness with the salad and the already salty bacon and duck brought it too far in acidity level. This isn't too big of a problem though because it wasn't incorporated directly onto the dish so I could choose how much of the sauce I wanted to eat. 

I think also there were too many bacon bits, and it ruined the texture a little. The bacon was definitely well seasoned, but they were pretty salty and chewy, and the ratio of bacon to everything else was too high. It contrasted too much with the tender duck, so I'd prefer if there were less. Still fire tho.

4/5

***Ricotta Ravioli***

I had high hopes for this dish. Ricotta Ravioli with duck confit and a mushroom sauce on top. It sounded like everything I already liked. It's hard to mess up cheese, mushrooms, and ravioli.

Maybe the lesson learned is to not have high hopes or when they're shattered the disappointment is too great.

I tried this after eating the duck confit, so I really thought it'd be just as good. The meat was dry, almost like meat floss instead of tender. The ravioli itself was very dry because of all the ricotta in it, and the sauce was mid at best. Also, it was sweet, which I thought was a strange pairing for this ravioli. I let my parents make the effort to finish this plate. The sacrifices you have to make as a parents are so diverse.

1/5

***Chicken Basque***
![Chez Lionel Chicken Basque](/images/Foodball/chez_lionel/chez_lionel_chicken_basque.JPG "Are Those Really Mashed Potatoes?")

The chicken basque didn't stand out to me. I think the entire dish lacked flavor as a whole, but I was able to finish the dish. The chicken was cooked and seasoned nicely, but the mashed potatoes were a bit too fine for my taste. I prefer my mashed potatoes to have have texture rather than be mashed into baby food. There was too much butter mixed into the potatoes, so it felt like everything was melting immediately, which made the dish blander because of how many potatoes there were.  

Something that also ruined the texture were the olives. Since the mashed potatoes and chicken were so hard, the olives were an unwelcome crunchy texture, not to mention they were the only source of saltiness. While the dish needed saltiness, I don't think small salt bombs were the way to do it.

3/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

Reasonably priced. I think that this was a good first choice for French food in Montreal. Everything was well-portioned and for the price that you're paying, the service and food reflects that amount. I think that I shouldn't have ordered the ravioli (not my order), but I am satisfied with the other dishes. The staff were friendly and were very attentive to our meal, but it felt like it was because they truly cared about customer satisfaction and not in an overly "I want a good tip" way.

Compared to the introduction, this restaurant made me like Montreal a little more. 

Unfortunately, the score got lowered because of the ravioli, but I would go back to this place solely for the escargot and duck confit if I ever return to Montreal.
