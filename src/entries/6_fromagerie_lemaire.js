  content: `## INTRODUCTION

  It's only natural that when you go to Canada, you have to have poutine. Because what other food does Canada have? (Not derogatory, genuinely wondering). 

  Fromagerie Lemaire is a cheese shop right in the middle of nowhere, but conveniently located right on the side of the freeway on the way from Montreal to Quebec City. I would have overlooked this shop if it didn't have almost 5K reviews.

  Since I have FOMO and a craving for poutine, I decided that this would be a good place to stop. 

  When we pulled up, it felt I was transported back to 2006. The whole restaurant was cow themed, with milk barrels and cow printed tables, and an inflatable cow in the middle of the restaurant. 

  One of the first things I noticed was how big on advertisement they were. Within a 5 ft radius (including the bathroom) there were at least 2 posters advertising the power dog poutine, which was their poutine of the day. I thought it was overkill considering I was already standing in their restaurant, but whatever.

  For a place that was in the middle of nowhere, there was a very long line for the food. I was expecting the line to be mostly tourists who also got sucked in by Google reviews, but there were local construction workers and other businessmen buying their lunches there as well, so my expectations became higher.

  ***Power Dog Poutine***

  NGL, I felt pretty silly ordering the "Power Dog Poutine". 

  I didn't like the sausage on top. Usually I really like bacon wrapped hot dogs, but the whole thing was too soft. When I think of a sausage, I think of the ones with a Costco hot dog consistency with a firm skin and a clean breakoff when you bite through it. This one felt like squeezing meat through a piping bag, so I didn't enjoy it. 

  The actual poutine was the original flavor with regular gravy and cheese curds. I enjoyed this part the most. The fries were just crunchy enough even with all the gravy on top, and the cheese curds were perfectly squeaky. I should have just gotten the regular poutine and not tried anything fancy. 

  3/5


  ***Thai Style Poutine***

  This wouldn't have been my first pick, but I decided to be friendly and ask the cashier what her favorite poutine was. If you saw my Chez Lionel post, you'd know that the best dish from there was the one that the waiter recommended, so I wanted to try my luck again. 

  So here we are with the Thai-Style Poutine with BBQ sauce. This poutine has fried chicken, sweet chili, and green onions on it. I suppose you can call any dish Asian if you top some green onions on top.

  The cashier had shit taste. 

  The sweet chili sauce combined with the BBQ sauce made the dish entirely too sweet, and it didn't go well with the fried chicken. The green onions added nothing to the dish besides the texture, which threw everything off because it didn't belong there. 

  The only good thing about the dish were the cheese curds, since the fries got too soggy from all the sauce and there was a strange aftertaste to the sauce. Even with 3 people, we fought to finish the small plate of food. 

  1.5/5


  ## OVERALL THOUGHTS

  This was a quick and easy place to stop by and get some fast food. The shop also sells various types of cheese, which I was super tempted to get, but didn't have a way to bring it back home. I think that if you were to come here, just stick with regular poutine with gravy. Or at least, don't try the "Asian Inspired" poutines.
