  content: `## INTRODUCTION

  It's only natural that when you go to Canada, you have to have poutine. Because what other food does Canada have that other countries don't? (Not derogatory, genuinely wondering).

  I was trying to find out a time to eat it on this trip, so while looking at places to stop during the road trip from Montreal to Quebec City, I found this place.

  Fromagerie Lemaire is a cheese shop right in the middle of nowhere, but conveniently located right on the side of the freeway. I would have overlooked this shop if it didn't have almost 5K reviews
