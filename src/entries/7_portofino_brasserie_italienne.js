    content: `## INTRODUCTION
  Date I went: 7/9/2025

  Before I start on this place, let me explain why there's such a big time skip between this one and the last entry. I realized that since I was picking and choosing which restaurants to write about and skipping over some in between, the way I had the date set up to be the day that I went to the restaurant would mean that the reviews I wrote would show up under the more recent ones. So I've decided to relabel it to be the day I wrote the review, and just put the date I went at the top of each review from now on. Foodball Rebrand Era.

  Anyways.

  This place wasn't one that I intended to go to in Quebec City. I was looking for some French food, but apparently the French food is $$$$. How pretentious.

  While exploring Old Quebec, I went around looking for places that would look good on my new digicam. 

  Which leads us to our current predicament. I climbed a hill. And a bunch of stairs. I want to explore the hill. But I'm hungry. I don't want to go back down the hill to eat.

  After scrolling through a bunch of places near me, I gave up on French food and we decided to go to this place, which had pretty good reviews and was reasonably priced for a tourist area.

  This place has an identity crisis. Half of the restaurant felt like a classic American diner, and the other half was candlelit pizza oven bar seating. The rest of the place was decorated with F1 posters and driver autographs from whenever F1 was racing in Portofino. 

## FOOD

  ***Bruschetta***

  I think it's hard to mess up bruschetta. It's bread, cheese, tomatoes, and some herbs. It'd be more impressive if they messed that up. 

  This one is no exception. It's just a regular bruschetta, with some balsamic glaze on it. The only thing that I didn't like was that the bread was just a bit too hard, but I'm sure if I let the tomatoes soak into the bread a bit more, it could have been better. 

  3/5

  ***Mushroom Risotto***

  I don't remember if I've had a risotto before. In my mind, it reminded me of congee, so I always just stuck to pastas whenever I had the choice. However, I was feeling kinda freaky tonight (I didn't want pasta), so we ordered this dish. 

  It's a good thing we only ordered one main to split, because this definitely took all of our efforts. It doesn't look like a huge amount, but the food was so rich and heavy. 

  Although it was so rich the flavor was actually really good. I think that this was a good choice. There was a clear cream and mushroom flavor that was very aromatic. However, the actual mushrooms in the risotto had a strange aftertaste that ruined the flavor for me. I think that as I kept eating, the risotto got increasingly salty, but it was bearable since I only ate a part of it. I definitely don't think I can order this again if I were going to be the only one eating it. 

  3/5

  ***Shrimp Mango Salad***

  This salad was meant to cut through any oiliness, since we'd been eating pretty heavy food for the past few days. It did the job. Not very well though. 

  While the salad itself was very refreshing, the shrimp tasted like it was soaked in water for long enough that it was falling apart. Each bite had water, which ruined the taste of the shrimp. 

  Also, there were some berries on the side, which was a suprprise for a "shrimp mango salad". I didn't mind it, but I don't think it added anything to the dish as a whole other than presentation.

  2.5/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

  This place didn't impress me. It felt pretty ordinary for an Italian place, but I wouldn't mind coming back here to try their pizzas if I have a chance. The food was resonably priced from comparison with other places.
