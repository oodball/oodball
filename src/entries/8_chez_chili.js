Date I went: 7/10/2025

We were planning to go to a French-Japanese fusion restaurant nearby, but all tables were reserved for the night. So we decided to go to the land of our people: Chinatown.

This place was heavily recommended by Reddit as one of the best Chinese restaurants in Montreal. We'll see about that.

When we first walked into Chinatown, I realized I could actually understand what everyone was saying. The entire time this trip, I was listening to all these people yap in French. Good sign #1. 

I was pleased walking into Chez Chili. I walked in to see a bunch of Asian people sitting in the restaurant. Good sign #2.

That's where the good signs end.

## FOOD

***Dry Fried Beans***

This was the best dish of the night. Which isn't saying too much. 

The beans had a very nice crunch to them, and there was a ton of flavor. I thought the beans were too salty though. It's almost like the beans took all the flavoring from all the other dishes. Since we had rice though, it was bearable. 

Until we ran out of rice.

2.5/5

***Fried Chicken***

One of my favorite parts of eating at Northern Chinese cuisine is the fried chicken. The chicken is usually some of the crispiest, most flavorful and juicy chicken I've had. 

Not this one though.

The chicken had no flavor. And it was at this point that I noticed something cruicial in the restaurant.

Which Chinese restaurant ever has decor of forks and knives. I should have paid more attention when I walked in. I was blinded by Reddit and desperation.

The chicken wasn't marinated in anything. It was in larger chunks than I'm normally used to, and each piece was dry. It was hard to finish this dish. 

In fact I don't think we did. 

1.5/5

***Noodle Stir Fry***

I don't remember eating this one. It can't have been that good. 

2/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

Montreal Reddit does not know what they're yapping about. This place was pretty disappointing to be called one of the best Chinese food in the city. I don't recommend going here. At least the price was reasonable. 

Find other places to eat than here.
