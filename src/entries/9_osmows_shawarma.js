Date I went: 7/11/2025

Because I didn't do my research properly, I ended up consulting Ottawa Reddit for recommendations again for what to eat.

I don't have a good impression of Ottawa. There were significantly more homeless people than I've ever seen in any other downtown. Most of them didn't do anything, but there were others that would come up to you. One guy just straight up pulled his pants down and peed right in front of me. I'd love to say it's not the first time that happened but it's not. Something something 2 nickels something not much but funny it happened twice or something. 

I think that Ottawa had the coolest buildings I've seen this trip though. We got to walk into the Notre Dame and the Art Museum and Parliament Hill. It felt like being in Europe.

Osmow's Shawarma is a small place that had a lot of customers near my hotel. It's right outside Byward Market, and Reddit said they recommended eating shawarma around here, so I looked up the top-rated shawarma places and found Osmow's. 

## FOOD

***Lamb Shawarma***

I didn't realize a shawarma bowl is quite literally protein on a rice bowl with some veggies and sauce. It wasn't some cool new fancy invention like I was expecting. 

That said, I ate it up. If I were a bit hungrier I could have finished the entire bowl. I should have.

The bowl was big though. Even 2 people could share it.

I got my shawarma bowl with lamb, mild spice, and half salad and half rice. 

The lamb was a bit dry, but the sauce made up for it. Each bite had a very nice balance of sauce to food, and the flavor hit me the first bite. It made me want more. 

Until it didn't. The rice started getting a bit dry and hard when the sauce wasn't there, and I started to get a bit full, so it got less enjoyable. Something about cognitive science and habituation and stuff so your enjoyment goes down the more you get used to something.

I bet you didn't learn that in your CS courses.

The rice had really good flavor, but it would be nicerif it were just a little bit more soft. 

3/5

## OVERALL THOUGHTS

If I have the chance I would come back to eat more. In hindsight, I enjoyed it alot more than in the moment because I was just so tired of driving all day. 

Before I go back here though, I'd like to try other shawarma places. While this place was highly rated on Google, there were higher rated ones that were further away, or in busier places.

Also, the food is pretty good value for what you're getting. The box was overflowing with food, and the cashiers were nice and patient while I was asking questions. I didn't feel rushed to make any decisions, so I'm happy with my lamb shawarma. 

If I lived in Ottawa, shawarma places would profit so much from me.

Just like Chipotle.
